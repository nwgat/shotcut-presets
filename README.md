Best video and audio for a given filesize for those that likes quality above compatibility, these pesets use hyper reize for better resize 

**Matroska or WebM Container** 
more awesome than anything else and its natively supported on Linux, Windows 10, many media players, webm container is itself a subset of matroska

**Opus Audio Codec** 
by the IETF, its supported by alot of devices already and is basicly the cream-la-cream of audio as its far supirior to mp3/aac and is the sucessor to vorbis

**VP9 Video Codec**
Modern open source codec from webm/google

**x265/HEVC**
another new codec

**x264/AVC**
good old x264, but with supirior opus or flac audio
